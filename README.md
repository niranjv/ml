# ML
My experiments with various ML tools & algorithms:

## Python

|   |  |
|--------|-------------|
| [NumPy](numpy/) | Efficient storage for large multi-dimensional arrays & <br/> vectorized functions operating on these arrays |
| [pandas](pandas/) | Labeled access to column-oriented data frames & series |
| [scikit-learn](scikit-learn/) | Machine learning in Python (single machine only) |
| [matplotlib/Seaborn](#matplotlib-seaborn-notes.ipynb) | High-level (Seaborn) & low-level (matplotlib) visualization libraries |
| [iPython/Jupyter](jupyter-notes.ipynb) | Notebooks for interactive computing, prototyping and reporting |
| PyMC | Bayesian statistical model fitting with MCMC |
| [xgboost](xgboost/) | Scalable gradient boosting (typically used with decision trees) <br/> with interfaces to Python & R |

## R

| | |
|--------|-------------|
| RStudio | IDE for R programming |
| R notebooks | Interactive R markdown doc with executable chunks <br/> (alternative to Jupyter notebooks for R) |
| data.table | Faster version of data.frame to handle large data sets (100s of GB) |
| caret | Classification & regression models |
| mlr | Machine learning in R  |
| forecast | Analyze univariate time series | 
| metrics, MLmetrics | Common evaluation metrics in machine learning  |
| xgboost | Scalable gradient boosting (typically used with decision trees) <br/> with interfaces to Python & R |
| hadley-verse: dplyr, tidyr, stringr, httpr, knitr, devtools, feather, testthat, devtools, ggplot2 | Tools for data manipulation, unit testing, package development & plotting |
| Stan, RStan | Bayesian inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational inference & penalized ML with interfaces to R & Python |

## Spark

| | |
|--------|-------------|
| SparkR  | R package to interface with Spark |
| PySpark  | Python interface to Spark |
| MLLib  | Spark's Scalable machine learning library <br/> with interfaces to Python & R |
| Databricks notebooks  | Interactive Jupyter-like notebooks <br/> for Spark programming in Python, R, etc. |
| Spark on AWS EMR  | Run Spark clusters in AWS with access to S3 & Hive |

AWS ML - Machine learning as a service for creating and deploying models <br/> with support for linear & logistic regression

## Deep Learning

| | |
|--------|-------------|
| Keras + TensorFlow/Theano  | Python package to enable fast experimentation with deep learning <br/> frameworks like TensorFlow & Theano on CPUs & GPUs |
| mxnet | Deep learning library with interfaces to Python & R |
