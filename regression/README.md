# Overview
Explore regression in scikit-learn, R, Spark MLLib

# Investigations
* sklearn: [OLS vs. Ridge Regression (CV) vs. LASSO (CV) vs. Elastic Net (CV)](OLS%20vs%20Ridge_CV%20vs%20LASSO_CV%20vs%20ElasticNet_CV.ipynb)
* Ridge Regression (CV) vs. Bayesian Linear Regression with Normal prior
* LASSO regression (CV) vs. Bayesian Linear Regression with double Exponential (Laplace) prior
* OLS vs. Principal Components Regression vs. Partial Least Squares Regression vs. Ridge Regression
* Show variance of covariates has no effect (i.e., multiplying covariate by `c` will result in coefficient multiplied by `1/c`)
