Association rule learning - discover interesting relations between variables

# Problems
* Association Rules (with confidence score)
 * Order of items is not considered
* Sequential pattern mining
 * Order of items matters

## Algorithms
* FP-growth - find frequent itemsets without traversing all possible itemsets
* PrefixSpan

## Tools
* Spark
* R
* Python
